    Alhamdulilah thank god for today. I went to some places, make myself to feel comfortable and feel better today. To be honest, I
really love it!!!<br/><br/>

    I know that I'd been stress for the last 3 days. However, today, I felt so happy and found my inner peace. I met my bestfriend and also
a psychiatrist to diagnose the problem that I felt on that day. I think I felt much more better as I'm having fun with my bestfriend.
Thank you so much for spending time with me today. I felt energetic and much more positive today and I know that I have to overcome my problems
one by one.<br/><br/>

    Tbh, I know one of the most heartbreaking moment for me is when my girlfriend wanted to breaking up with me. But I tried to sit down and asking
myself why did this happened? I know that for everything that happened in our lives, there must be a reason for it.

    I feeling more happier than ever after long stressful day for the last 3 days.
