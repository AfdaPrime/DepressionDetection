                <p>Depression is a common illness worldwide, with an estimated 3.8% of the population affected, 
including 5.0% among adults and 5.7% among adults older than 60 years. Approximately 280 
million people in the world have depression. Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations 
and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life. Especially when recurrent and 
with moderate or severe intensity, depression may become a serious health condition. It can cause 
the affected person to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school and in the family. At its 
worst, depression can lead to suicide. Over 700 000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is 
the fourth leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds.
    
Although there are known, effective treatements for mental disorders, more than 75% of people in low 
and mild-income countries receive no treatment. Barriers to effective care include a lack of 
resources, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders. In 
countries of all income levels, people who experience depression are often not correct diagnosed, 
and others who do not have the disorder are too often misdiagnosed and prescribed antidepressants.
