    I am so stressed right now!!! I really have a thought about killing myself today!!! I literally crying the whole day!!!<br/><br/>

    Today when I went to the school, I accidentally wake up late. This is due to I accidentally mute my phone before I went to sleep. When I woke up, I rushed to take a shower and wear my school uniform.
When I go out, I already miss my school bus. This force me to walk to school which is located around 2.1km from my house. When I arrived at school he discipline teacher who waited at the front of the
school gate scolded me and punishes me by asking me to wear a sign on my neck that is written "I'm late". This is so embarassing as a lot of my friends and pupils saw me wearing this sign.<br/><br/>

    In the class, the teacher asked me to hand in our homework. I knew that I already finished it before. However, it is not in my bag!!! I literally panicked as I remember that I left it on the table
at home as I was rushing to go to school. The teacher punishes me by asking me to stand on the chair for the whole English class. All of my classmates are laughing at me and I started to crying a little bit.

    NOT JUST THAT!!! ON THE SAME DAY, MY GIRLFRIEND ASKING TO BREAKING UP WITH ME!!! I seriously having a total depression, sad and hearth broken. I felt like today is the worst day of my life and maybe I
am so unlucky today. I'm not sure what God wanted from me or why does he did this to me. I already having a bad day and right now he tests me with the left of love of my life??? I just wanted a happy
normal school day as other people. I already having a little depression 2 days before and now... I don't know what to say...<br/><br/>

    When I back home, I run towards my room and crying over myself. I really felt like I wanted to kill myself at the moment. i felt so tired with life today. I felt like I don't know what to do in the future.
My heart was crushed and I can't stop crying. I barely eat today as I don't feel well. Some of my stuff are broken because of my rage that I felt today. <br/><br/>

    However, I knew that I can stand this and make myself felt nice. I think I'm gonna do something to calm down my mind and find inner peace tomorrow.
