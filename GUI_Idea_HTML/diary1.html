    Welcome to the first day of June 2022!!! Tbh I really hoping for the best for this month. But I'm not quite sure if it is. I felt
something bad is hoing to happen this month. However, I'm trying to get rid that from my mind. <br/><br/>

    Everything went normal for me as a student. I know that tomorrow my schedule is going to be packed and I'm quite nervouse and anxious
about that. Today is Wednesday and yes we will be having cocuriculum in our school. Nothing bad happen yet but I'm quite mad for a few
little things such as my favourite food is quickly finished today, my favourite pen is gone and my watter spilled on my notebook. <br/><br/>

    All of these things kinda pisses me off a little bit. But yeah I think everything is fine. And I can no my best for the whole month.
