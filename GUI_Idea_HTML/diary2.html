    Today is just another normal day as a student. Went to school, learn things and back home.<br/><br/>

    However, there is still some of the things that causes me to be stressed today. There are a lot of homeworks that I need to finish!!!
Not to mention, today I also having a piano test at 4.45PM and yes ofc I need to study for my Piano Test. If not, my parents are going to
scold me. Other than that, I also have a meeting with my group mate to discuss about our school project at 7.00PM. after that I need to go
to my Badminton training at Ukay Perdana on 9.30PM.<br/><br/>

    I swear to god that I have so many things to do, focus and participate in one day. I felt like I'm having a migrain at the moment.
Not to mention about the other house chores that I need to do such as picking up cat shit, cleaning up the house and many more. I know
that my parents went to work and back home tired. But I also hope that they understand the feeling of their son. I also have another works
and commitment that I need to achieve and finish. Why did I felt like they are treating me like a slave???<br/><br/>

    With the migrain that I'm facing right now, I think I am just going to take a panadol and take a rest for a moment. And after that I will continue
with all of the works that I need to do.
